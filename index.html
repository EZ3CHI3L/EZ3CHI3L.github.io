                    "Son,'he said,' ye cannot in your present state understand
                    eternity... That is what mortals misunderstand.
                    They say of some temporal suffering, "No future bliss can
                    make up for it," not knowing that
                    Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and
                    turn even that agony into a glory.
                    And of some sinful pleasure they say "Let me have but
                    this and I'll take the consequences":
                    little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back
                    into their past and contaminate
                    the pleasure of the sin.
                    Both processes begin even before death. The good man's
                    past begins to change so that his forgiven sins
                    and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven:
                    the bad man's past already conforms to his
                    badness and is filled only with dreariness.
                    And that is why... the Blessed will say "We have never
                    lived anywhere except in Heaven, : and the Lost,
                    "We were always in Hell."
                    And both will speak truly."
