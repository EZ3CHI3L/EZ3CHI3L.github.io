            "Son,'he said,' ye cannot in your present state understand
             eternity... That is what mortals misunderstand.
            They say of some temporal suffering, "No future bliss can
             make up for it," not knowing that
            Heaven, once attained, will work backwards and
             turn even that agony into a glory.
            And of some sinful pleasure they say "Let me have but
             this and I'll take the consequences":
            little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back
             into their past and contaminate
            the pleasure of the sin.
            Both processes begin even before death. The good man's
             past begins to change so that his forgiven sins
            and remembered sorrows take on the quality of Heaven:
             the bad man's past already conforms to his
              badness and is filled only with dreariness.
            And that is why... the Blessed will say "We have never
             lived anywhere except in Heaven, : and the Lost,
              "We were always in Hell."
            And both will speak truly."
